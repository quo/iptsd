Please use the official iptsd from the linux-surface project instead:

https://github.com/linux-surface/iptsd/

(The libqzed branch of this repository contains an old fork of iptsd, but this will no longer work with ithc as of commit 0b55642 ("Remove old /dev/ithc API"). The changes from this fork have been merged into the offical iptsd.)
